### Summary
The project focuses on the healthcare sector, utilizing a 2020 dataset extracted from the BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) in the US. It involves analyzing responses to a questionnaire that provides information on lifestyle habits and the prevalence of pathologies taking into account the sociodemographic context of the respondents.

### Keywords
BRFSS 2020, health data analysis, pathology prediction, risk factor identification, sociodemographic factors

### Contributions
Data selection and some visualization ideas were developed in collaboration with Arvind and Julie, whom I thank. EDA's coding, the machine learning parts in Python and Streamlit were carried out individually.

### Objectives
- Visualize trends and correlations within the data.
- Identify the main risk factors associated with different pathologies.
- Provide an interactive tool via Streamlit to explore predictions and analyses.
